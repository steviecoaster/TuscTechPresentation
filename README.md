# TuscTechPresentation
A repo of the scripts I used in demonstration during my talk.

Thanks for your interest in my examples. Please feel free to download/pull/fork/etc etc to your heart's content. 
I can answer any questions, or provide help to you if you would like. Please use the Issues tab above to submit your question. It is a great way to keep track of things, and changes I or you make to the scripts to answer the questions, can be linked backed to the issue.
